# Calculator
Calculator app with PlainJS + React. A test task from an interview.

# Task
Make a calculator app with Plain JS and recreate it with React.
The app must:
- Support all the functionality from the stock Microsoft Calculator app for Windows.
- Support parenthesis in expressions.
- Can't use `eval`, `new Function`, and any other execution functions.
- Can't use any math libraries

# Results
I created the apps in about 3.5 hours.
All the functionality seems to be working well.
CSS was hand-written, no preprocessors.
The apps look and function identically.
The expressions are parsed with Regex and then evaluated based on the operator sign.
